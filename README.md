# Magic: The Gathering - Inventory APP

There are several extremely well made inventory apps, but this web application is a challenge to myself to create something I can store my inventory of MTG cards. Additionally, I want to create a way to display my decks and build decks with the cards I have in my inventory.

## Goals

* Become more familiar with ReactJS to pursue a development role.
* Identify every card I have in my possession.
* Find the potential worth of every card I own.
* Grow more knowledgeable in the web development space and grow my interest in web development.

### Integrations

* Scryfall.com API
* Create React App
* React-Router-Dom
* Bootstrap 5 (with free dark theme CSS)
